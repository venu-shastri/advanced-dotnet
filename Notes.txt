Dispose Method Implementation Challenges

1. Startergy for resticing an access to a dispose object
2. Startergy for handling multiple dispose method calls
3. Requires Explicit Invocation


Dispose Method Chracterstics
1. Requires Explicit Method Call - Deterministic Destructor
2. Disposed Objects Requires One Gc Cycle to remove from the Memory , provided no other roots exist.


Finalize method 

1. Non Deterministic Destrcutor - Invoked Implicitly 
2. Invoked on Finalizer Thread
3. Finalized Object Requires minimum 2 GC Cycles
4. Gc Mark an object only when object is not reachble



How object is finalized



Object Disposed Pattern



Object Persistance :- "Preseve Object State" 

Serialization and Deserialization


Deep Serialization						Shallow Serialization

1.Private and Non private Data Members				1.Public state of an instance.

2.Runtime Type and Assembly Information				2.POX (plain old xml)

3.Binary or SOAP Message Format					3.XML Format

4.Requires Type must an-notate with [Serializable]		4.Requires Type must have public defualt Constructor

5..Net remoting uses Deep Serailzation for object state transfer 5. .Net WebServices , ADO.net Entity Fx Uses Shallow Serialization
